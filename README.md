### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for visiting my profile. I have been working with the technology over past years and have expertise in building rest api, automation, data engineering, and data science using python. I am learning about cloud technology and apply cloud related architectures with data engineering, and analytics domains.  

ðŸ”­ I have been working currently with a products in AWS.  

Meantime, I also do some contribution to help anyone. Below are some good references of my projects:
